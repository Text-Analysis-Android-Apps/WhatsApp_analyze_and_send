# WhatsCheck
WhatsCheck is the prototype of an Android application to send messages over WhatsApp specifying the target phone number and country code and the desired message to send.
But this version has something other similar applications do not have. It ships TensorFlow Lite algorythms to enable the user to analyze the sentiments of the message before sending it to the final person.
It informs the user of how offensive or non-offensive the message is.

For now this is a mix of [WhatsApp Direct](https://github.com/HafizYasir/WhatsAppDirect) by [HafizYasir](https://github.com/HafizYasir) and [Custom Text Classification on Android using TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/NSTiwari/Custom-Text-Classification-on-Android-using-TF-Lite) by [NSTiwari](https://github.com/NSTiwari/).
